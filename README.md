# Scrabble-words

A simple  ember App I put together for my grandparents to easily find valid 2 letter words while playing scrabble.
{Previously they used to have a long print out which they used to manually scan through)

### Contributing

May come back to this later to make it a more comprehensive scrabble help tool. Things like having all thee valid scrabble words, intelligent word guessers, (given a set of constraints like board state and available chips, list all valid words). Feel free to suggest/add new features.
